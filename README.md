Timber is a different kind of logging system; it's built specifically for application developers. It goes beyond raw log files with full text searching. In Timber, each log line is captured with it's context, providing powerful search capabilities. In effect turning each log line into a data-rich event. Because of this you could do things like:

1. View logs generated by a specific user (including yourself!).
2. View logs generated by a specific controller.
3. View logs for a specific session.
4. ...and much more
