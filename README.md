# Timber

**Note: this Readme is underconstruction, we're currently in alpha testing**

Timber is the logging system I wish I had for the past 8 years. It takes logging a step further by add context. Context makes your logs unbelievably powerful and meaningful enabling a wide variety of use cases.

We're currently testing with select alpha testers. If you're interested in getting early access visit http://timber.io
