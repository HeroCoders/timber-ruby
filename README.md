## What is Timber?

[Timber](http://timber.io) is a different kind of logging platform; it goes beyond traditional
logging by automatically enriching your logs with application level metadata, turning them
into rich, structured events without altering the essence of logging.

For example, it turns this:

```
Completed 200 OK in 117ms (Views: 85.2ms | ActiveRecord: 25.3ms)
```

Into this:

```json
{
  "dt": "2016-12-01T02:23:12.236543Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Completed 200 OK in 117ms (Views: 85.2ms | ActiveRecord: 25.3ms)",
  "context": {
    "http": {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/checkout",
      "remote_addr": "123.456.789.10",
      "request_id": "abcd1234"
    },
    "user": {  # <---- http://i.giphy.com/EldfH1VJdbrwY.gif
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Ben Johnson",
      "email": "ben@johnson.com"
    }
  },
  "event": {
    "http_response": {
      "status": 200,
      "time_ms": 117
    }
  }
}
```

Notice we include data that isn't in the log message directly. It does the same for
`http requests`, `sql queries`, `exceptions`, `template renderings`, and any other event
your framework logs.

(for a full list see [`Timber::Events`](lib/timber/events))


## Why Timber?

Glad you asked! :)

1. It's application aware and enriches your logs with data you can't get otherwise. This
   entire process is fully managed for you.
2. It defines a shared schema across all of our libraries. Meaning your log data, across all
   applications, will be normalized.
3. It does not alter the original log message, giving you the best of both worlds: human
   readable logs *and* rich structured events.
4. It's completely transparent with absolutely no vendor lock-in or risk of code debt. Timber
   adheres exactly to the `Logger` API. Meaning Timber can be installed and removed without
   any reprocusion.

What really makes Timber unique is that at the end of the day it's just good ol' loggin'.
No special API, no proprietary data format, the data is accessible and owned by you.
[Woo!](http://i.giphy.com/7JYWGKgwxga5i.gif)


## Logging Custom Events

> Another service? More lock-in? :*(

Nope! Logging custom events is Just Loggingâ„¢. Check it out:

```ruby
# Simple string (original Logger interface remains untouched)
Logger.warn "Payment rejected for customer abcd1234, reason: Card expired"

# Structured hash
Logger.warn message: "Payment rejected", type: :payment_rejected,
  data: %{customer_id: "abcd1234", amount: 100, reason: "Card expired"}

# Using a Struct
PaymentRejectedEvent = Struct.new(:customer_id, :amount, :reason) do
  def message; "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"; end
  def type; :payment_rejected; end
end
Logger.warn PaymentRejectedEvent.new("abcd1234", 100, "Card expired")
```

(for more examples, see [the `Timber::Logger` docs](lib/timber/logger.rb))

No mention of Timber anywhere!


## The Timber Console / Pricing

Like my mother always said:

> What good is structured log data if you can't search and visualize it?

Enter [the Timber Console](https://timber.io). It's a modern, fast, and beautiful console for
searching and visualizing your logs.

A few example queries:

  1. `context.user.email:ben@johnson.com` - Tail a specific user!
  2. `context.http.request_id:1234` - View *all* logs for a given HTTP request!
  3. `event.http_reponse.time_ms>3000` - Easily find outliers and have the proper context to resolve them!
  4. `level:warn` - Log levels in your logs. Imagine that!

> This is all gravy, but wouldn't the extra data get expensive?

If you opt use the [Timber Console](https://timber.io), we only charge for
the size of the `message`, `dt`, and `event.custom` attributes. Everything else is
stored at no cost to you. [Say wha?!](http://i.giphy.com/l0HlL2vlfpWI0meJi.gif). This ensures
pricing remains predictable. We charge per GB sent to us and retained. No user limits,
no weird feature matrixes, just data. Finally, the data is yours, in a simple
non-proprietary JSON format that you can export to S3, Redshift, or any of our other integrations.

For more details checkout out [timber.io](https://timber.io).

## Install

### 1. Install the gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'timber'
```

### 2. Install the logger:

#### Heroku:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)
config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
```

The command to add your log drain will be displayed in the [Timber app](https://app.timber.io)
after you add your application.

#### Non-Heroku:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)
log_device = Timber::LogDevices::HTTP.new(ENV['TIMBER_KEY']) # key can be obtained by signing up at https://timber.io
config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(log_device)
```

Your Timber application key will be displayed in the [Timber app](https://app.timber.io)
after you add your application.


*Other transport methods coming soon!*


#### Rails TaggedLogging?

No probs! Use it as normal, Timber will even pull out the tags and include them in the `context`.

```ruby
config.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT))
```

**Warning**: Tags lack meaningful descriptions, they are a poor mans context. Not to worry though!
Timber provides a simple system for adding custom context that you can optionally use. Checkout
[the `Timber::CurrentContext` docs](lib/timber/current_context.rb) for examples.

That's it! Log to your heart's content.
